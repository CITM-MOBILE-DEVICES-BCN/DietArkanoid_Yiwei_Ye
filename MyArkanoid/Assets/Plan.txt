Planning Phase (Updated):

Game Architecture:

Use a Singleton pattern for the GameManager to handle game state, score, and lives.
Implement a State pattern for managing different game states (Main Menu, Gameplay, Pause, Game Over, Level Completed).
Use an Observer pattern for updating the HUD and other UI elements.


Core Components:

Platform (player-controlled or auto-mode)
Ball
Bricks (multiple types with varying resistance)
Power-ups


Scenes:

Main Menu
Gameplay (at least 2 levels)
Pause Menu (overlay)
Game Over screen
Level Completed screen


Persistent Data:

High score
Player lives
Current level
Game settings (music volume, SFX volume, fullscreen, V-Sync)


Features to Implement:

Ball physics (bouncing, increasing speed)
Brick destruction and scoring
Lives system
Power-up system
Screen adaptation (Landscape and Portrait modes)
Sound system (background music and sound effects)
Save/Load system for game progress and settings
V-Sync option in graphics settings


Design Patterns to Use:

Singleton: GameManager, AudioManager
State: GameStateManager
Observer: UIManager, ScoreManager
Factory: BrickFactory, PowerUpFactory
Command: InputHandler
